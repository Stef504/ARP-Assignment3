socketSERVER MODE:
- Communication Server reads MY drone position from Blackboard (via fdComm_FromBB)
- Communication Server writes CLIENT's position to Blackboard (via fdComm_ToBB) 
- Blackboard treats client position as obstacle and sends repulsion force to Drone

CLIENT MODE:
- Communication Client reads MY drone position from Blackboard (via fdComm_FromBB)
- Communication Client writes SERVER's position to Blackboard (via fdComm_ToBB)
- Blackboard displays server position but NO repulsion on client side

Mode 1:
Drone → fdToBB → BlackBoard (reads drone position)
BlackBoard → fdFromBB → Drone (sends position back)
BlackBoard → fdRepul → Drone (sends repulsion forces)
Obstacle Generator → fdOb → BlackBoard (obstacle positions)
Target Generator → fdTa → BlackBoard (target positions)

Mode 2:
Drone → fdToBB → BlackBoard (reads drone position)
BlackBoard → fdComm_FromBB → Communication Server (sends MY drone position)
Communication Server → fdComm_ToBB → BlackBoard (receives CLIENT's drone position as obstacle)
BlackBoard → fdRepul → Drone (applies repulsion from client's position)

Mode 3:
Drone → fdToBB → BlackBoard (reads MY drone position)
BlackBoard → fdComm_FromBB → Communication Client (sends MY drone position)
Communication Client → fdComm_ToBB → BlackBoard (receives SERVER's drone for display only)
BlackBoard DOES NOT send repulsion in client mode (client IS the disturbance)

Virtual Coodinate system: 
SERVER SIDE:
BlackBoard (local coords) → Communication Server → [converts to virtual] → Network

CLIENT SIDE:
Network → [converts to virtual] → Communication Client → BlackBoard (local coords)

Alpha Values:
0: Standard orientation.
pi/2 (90°): Rotates the world "sideways" (Portrait <-> Landscape).
pi (180°): Flips the world upside down.
-pi/2 (-90°): Rotates the other way.
